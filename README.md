# Covistance

Covistance is an application that uses open cv and a machine-learning algorithm that can recognize faces to determine if 2 or more people are properly socially-distanced in order to prevent the users getting COVID-19 at social events. There are two versions of the app, 3ft and 6ft, which check if the users are distanced according to those measurements. The two versions allow the user to follow social-distancing guidelines effectively during both high and low infection periods of COVID-19.

Users are able to download the app on our website that uses Auth0 to ensure a safe login and visiting experience.
